= JBoss integration platform BOM

Bill Of Materials for SwitchYard, Drools, OptaPlanner, jBPM, ...

== Building

----
$ mvn clean install
----

== Releasing

First run the maven-release plugin:

----
$ mvn release:prepare
$ mvn release:release
----

Then go to https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/[Nexus], log in and release the staging repository.

=== Version numbering

This BOM has it's own version numbering and release lifecycle.
Any similarity with Drools, jBPM or SwitchYard versions is a coincidence.
